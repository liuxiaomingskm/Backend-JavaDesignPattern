/**
 * Strategy:
 * Enables the exact behavior of a system to be selected either at run time(dynamic) or compile-time(static),
 *
 * Also known as a policy(esp. in the C++ world)
 * For example:
 * The process of making tea can be decomposed into
 * 1.The process of making a hot water
 * 2. Tea-specific things(put teabag into water)
 * The high-level algorithm can then be reused for making coffee or hot chocolate, supported by beverage-specific strategies
